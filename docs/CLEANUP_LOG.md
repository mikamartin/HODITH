# HODIT — Cleanup Log

A timestamped record of every cleanup pass, newest first. After any significant feature work, copy the checklist from [DEV_PLAYBOOK.md](DEV_PLAYBOOK.md) §1 into a new entry below, tick what was found and fixed, and note anything deferred with a reason.

## Entry format

```
## YYYY-MM-DD — <branch or feature name>

**Scope:** what work triggered this pass
**Found & fixed:** bullet list (or "nothing found" — that's a valid result)
**Deferred:** bullet list with reasons (or "nothing deferred")
**Docs updated:** SPEC / TESTING / PLAYBOOK sections touched, if any
```

## 2026-07-04 — chore/project-scaffold (Phase 0)

**Scope:** Repo init and Gradle/Android project scaffold — no product code yet, just the empty app skeleton and tooling.
**Found & fixed:** nothing to fix; no product logic exists yet for most checklist categories to apply to (duplication, decoupling, complexity, accessibility are all N/A pre-feature-code). Confirmed `git status` clean, `.gitignore` correctly excludes `local.properties`/`build/`/`.gradle/`, no secret-shaped files staged.
**Deferred:**
- Dependency versions are inline literals in `build.gradle.kts` rather than a Gradle version catalog (`libs.versions.toml`). Matches DEV_PLAYBOOK §5's matrix directly for now; revisit once the module/dependency count grows enough that duplication becomes a real problem.
- Instrumented-test environment (the documented Android 16 compatibility gap in TESTING.md) is still unverified — Phase 0 only exercised the JVM `test` task (no source, ran clean) and `ktlintCheck`; no emulator was used. Verification happens when Phase 1 lands the first DAO tests.
**Docs updated:** DEV_PLAYBOOK.md §5 tooling matrix updated in place with July 2026-verified versions (AGP 9.2.1, Hilt 2.60, Compose BOM 2026.06.01, Kotlin held at 2.3.20 pending KSP support, Room decision recorded). HODIT_SPEC.md and TESTING.md reviewed — no divergence, no changes needed (no product or test code landed this phase).
