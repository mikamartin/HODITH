# HODIT — Cleanup Log

A timestamped record of every cleanup pass, newest first. After any significant feature work, copy the checklist from [DEV_PLAYBOOK.md](DEV_PLAYBOOK.md) §1 into a new entry below, tick what was found and fixed, and note anything deferred with a reason.

## Entry format

```
## YYYY-MM-DD — <branch or feature name>

**Scope:** what work triggered this pass
**Found & fixed:** bullet list (or "nothing found" — that's a valid result)
**Deferred:** bullet list with reasons (or "nothing deferred")
**Docs updated:** SPEC / TESTING / PLAYBOOK sections touched, if any
```

## 2026-07-04 — feature/room-data-layer (Phase 1)

**Scope:** Room entities/DAOs/`HoditRepository`, JVM `Clock` abstraction, and their tests — first product code in the repo.
**Found & fixed:**
- Migrated `build.gradle.kts` files from inline dependency versions to `gradle/libs.versions.toml`, since this phase roughly doubled the dependency count (Room, coroutines, AndroidX test, Hilt testing).
- All six instrumented DAO test classes repeated the same `Room.inMemoryDatabaseBuilder(...).build()` boilerplate in `@Before` — extracted to a shared `createInMemoryDatabase()` helper in `TestFixtures.kt`.
- Enums stored as `String` (not ordinal `Int`) via `Converters.kt` — safer against future reordering/insertion of enum values.
- Tag cross-ref inserts use `OnConflictStrategy.IGNORE` so `HoditRepository.addTagToEvent` is idempotent.
**Deferred:**
- No domain logic beyond `Clock` exists yet (verdict/trigger/stats engines are Phase 5+), so most of DEV_PLAYBOOK §1's Decoupling/Complexity checks don't yet apply — revisit at that phase.
- `HoditRepository` mirrors the DAOs closely with no additional orchestration beyond tag find-or-create; ViewModel-level concerns (undo window, one-ongoing-per-case invariant) are explicitly Phase 3's job per TESTING.md.
**Docs updated:** TESTING.md — status line updated (Phase 1 landed), known-environment-issues note replaced with the actual verification result (25/25 instrumented DAO tests passed on a Pixel 6 AVD, API 34; the Android 16/API 36 compatibility gap flagged at Phase 0 remains unverified since no API 36 image was used). PROGRESS.md — Phase 1 checked off.

## 2026-07-04 — chore/project-scaffold (Phase 0)

**Scope:** Repo init and Gradle/Android project scaffold — no product code yet, just the empty app skeleton and tooling.
**Found & fixed:** nothing to fix; no product logic exists yet for most checklist categories to apply to (duplication, decoupling, complexity, accessibility are all N/A pre-feature-code). Confirmed `git status` clean, `.gitignore` correctly excludes `local.properties`/`build/`/`.gradle/`, no secret-shaped files staged.
**Deferred:**
- Dependency versions are inline literals in `build.gradle.kts` rather than a Gradle version catalog (`libs.versions.toml`). Matches DEV_PLAYBOOK §5's matrix directly for now; revisit once the module/dependency count grows enough that duplication becomes a real problem.
- Instrumented-test environment (the documented Android 16 compatibility gap in TESTING.md) is still unverified — Phase 0 only exercised the JVM `test` task (no source, ran clean) and `ktlintCheck`; no emulator was used. Verification happens when Phase 1 lands the first DAO tests.
**Docs updated:** DEV_PLAYBOOK.md §5 tooling matrix updated in place with July 2026-verified versions (AGP 9.2.1, Hilt 2.60, Compose BOM 2026.06.01, Kotlin held at 2.3.20 pending KSP support, Room decision recorded). HODIT_SPEC.md and TESTING.md reviewed — no divergence, no changes needed (no product or test code landed this phase).
