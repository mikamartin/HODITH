# HODITH — Build Progress

Main development (Phases 0–11) is complete. That build history lives in [CLEANUP_LOG.md](CLEANUP_LOG.md) (per-branch, newest-first) and git log, not here — this file tracks what's left.

## How this file is organised

Items are grouped by how they connect, not by feature area:

- **Story B — copy & Voice** — a short chain that has to land after everything else that touches copy.
- **Standalone** — isolated items with no cross-dependencies; pick any when resources are thin.
- **Deferred** — startable, but intentionally held back pending a trigger (usually real alpha usage) rather than gated on something external.
- **Blocked** — gated on something external; not startable now.

Each item carries:

- a **trailer** — *Branch · Complexity · Priority · Area*. Complexity: S ≤ a day · M a few days · L a week-plus · XL a new module or multi-week (same scale as HODITH_SPEC §17). Priority: High gates the first release or corrects something wrong today · Medium worth doing before alpha · Low cosmetic or deferrable · Blocked can't start yet. Area is a loose bucket — Bug / Big Picture / Insights / Notifications / Share / Settings / Voice / Performance / Repo.
- zero or more **tags** — 🎨 *Design decision* (needs a design or product-owner call before implementation) · 🌐 *External action* (work outside this repo) · 🔍 *Investigation* (needs a repro/diagnose pass before the fix is knowable).
- **Acceptance criteria** — the checklist that says "done".
- **Plan / Tests / Concern** — detail, unchanged from prior tracking.

## Story B — copy & Voice

Three items, plus the tail of nearly everything else. Anything that adds or changes a Voice key must land before B3.

### B1 · Square share format should become a fixed preset

*Branch: `feat/square-share-card-preset` · Complexity: M · Priority: Medium · Area: Share*

🎨 **Design decision** — which sections, and in what fixed order, Square always shows. Touches Voice copy, so before B3.

Story stays the one fully customizable, auto-sizing format. `shareCardState()` applies `selectedSections` identically to both formats, and `SharePreviewScreen.kt`'s `SectionsPicker`/`availableSections` render the same toggles for both — but Square keeps a 1:1 floor while Story sizes freely to content, so selecting every Insights section on Square produces a tall rectangle instead of the predictable square shape it's for.

**Acceptance criteria**

- [ ] A documented fixed section list + order for Square.
- [ ] `SectionsPicker` renders only when `ShareCardFormat.STORY` is selected.
- [ ] `shareCardState()` sources Square's sections from the fixed preset, independent of `selectedSections`.
- [ ] Story keeps full customization and content-sizing.
- [ ] Any Story-only picker copy goes through Voice ×3.
- [ ] Tests: `ShareCardStateTest.kt` (Square driven by preset), `SharePreviewScreenTest.kt` (picker only for Story); `ShareCardTemplateTest.kt` Square floor/no-clip still passes.
- [ ] `docs/mockups/share-cards-prototype.html` deleted and its `ShareCardDecoration.kt` KDoc pointer dropped — it was the last mockup left in that directory, kept only as this item's Story/Square section-layout reference (`chore/prune-design-mockups` removed the other five).

**Plan** — decide Square's fixed section list first. Then gate `SectionsPicker` to `ShareCardFormat.STORY` only, and source Square's sections from the preset in `shareCardState()`.

**Tests** — `ShareCardStateTest.kt` and `SharePreviewScreenTest.kt` cover the preset-driven output and Story-only picker; `ShareCardTemplateTest.kt`'s floor/no-clip tests keep passing unchanged.

### B2 · Share card summary beat

*Branch: `feat/share-card-summary-beat` · Complexity: M · Priority: Medium · Area: Share*

🎨 **Design decision** — what the summary says and how it reads in each theme's template. Touches Voice copy, so before B3.

The plain Reality beat (event count + days observed) is now the card's only top beat, since `chore/remove-hunch` retired the old Hunch vs. Reality punchline — "I checked: it does NOT always rain on my day off" — and a Case can carry several Notifications, so no single Notification's comparison can stand in for it. Replace Reality with a short summary beat that works for both Story and Square.

**Acceptance criteria**

- [ ] A documented summary shape (e.g. overall rate + observed span, with an optional voice-flavoured line), built from data the Insights tab already computes — no new domain math.
- [ ] Rendered in both Story and Square, in all three theme templates, without breaking Square's 1:1 floor or B1's fixed preset.
- [ ] Voice ×3 for any new copy, impersonal (no "I"/"you" — the viewer isn't the user).
- [ ] HODITH_SPEC.md §13 updated.

**Plan** — decide the summary shape with a cheap mockup first, then swap it in for Reality in `shareCardState()` and `ShareCardTemplate.kt`.

**Tests** — `ShareCardStateTest.kt` (summary content for both formats, edge cases: one event, no events), `ShareCardTemplateTest.kt` (fits and no-clip in both formats), `SharePreviewScreenTest.kt` if the preview gains or loses a control.

### B3 · Review phrasing across all three Voice implementations

*Branch: `chore/voice-phrasing-audit` · Complexity: L · Priority: Medium · Area: Voice*

🎨 **Design decision** — the rubric is an authored artifact and needs a human ear. **Must land last**, after every other copy-touching item (currently B1 and B2).

Fold these already-drafted key changes into the audit:

- `feat/declutter-nudges` — reworded Serious `checkInDueNotificationBody`; renamed `checkInsSummaryNotificationTitle` → `notificationsGroupSummaryTitle`.
- `feat/insights-from-first-event` — added `insightsNothingLoggedMessage`, `insightsSingleEventNote` (replacing `insightsNotEnoughDataMessage`).
- `feat/big-picture-overview-detail` — retired `bigPictureEventNoteEmptyState`; added `bigPictureDetailDialogTitle`, `bigPictureDetailEditDescription`, four shared field labels.

**Acceptance criteria**

- [ ] A written rubric: per-voice person, tense, sentence length, punctuation/emoji budget, locked Case/Event/Watch/Check-in vocabulary, and an em-dash policy with per-string calls for Goth/Quirky mid-sentence pivots.
- [ ] A findings list produced first; fixes in a separate second commit.
- [ ] Audit done in slices by screen, not by reading `Voice.kt` linearly.
- [ ] New mechanical `VoiceTest` invariants: vocabulary casing, no gamification vocabulary (streak/score/keep it up/missed — spec §4), length caps on tab/button labels, no double spaces or trailing whitespace.
- [ ] Confirmed before starting: `androidTest` references `PlainVoice` by constant, not literal, everywhere (grep for hardcoded UI literals).

**Plan** — write the rubric first (person, tense, sentence length, punctuation/emoji budget, locked Case/Event/Watch/Check-in vocabulary), then audit in slices by screen — not top to bottom, since `Voice.kt` is grouped by key. Produce a findings list first; fix in a second commit. Re-tally the per-voice/shared key split and the em-dash count before starting — `chore/remove-hunch` retired dozens of keys and touched dashes in the ones it rewrote, so the prior counts no longer hold.

**Tests** — `VoiceTest` already checks every key by reflection (non-blank in all three voices, no per-voice key identical across all three) plus the share-card pronoun rule. Add mechanical invariants during the audit: vocabulary casing, no gamification vocabulary (spec §4), length caps on tab/button labels, no double spaces or trailing whitespace. Confirm `androidTest` references `PlainVoice` by constant everywhere, not literal, before starting.

**Concern** — the audit will change hundreds of lines in one file. Anything else touching `Voice.kt` must land first.

## Standalone

No cross-dependencies — pick by appetite. Grouped by area below; items are identified by title or branch, not a number.

### App-icon handle butts directly against the lens ring with no clearance

*Branch: `fix/icon-handle-clearance` · Complexity: S · Priority: Low · Area: Bug*

In `app/src/main/res/drawable/ic_launcher_foreground.xml` the handle's inner edge (midpoint ~(62,62)) sits on the ring's outer stroke band (~63.7 along the diagonal).

**Acceptance criteria**

- [ ] The handle's two inner points (`58.818,65.182` and `65.182,58.818`) pushed outward along the (1,1) diagonal in `ic_launcher_foreground.xml`; mirrored in `ic_launcher_monochrome.xml`.
- [ ] Visible clearance between handle inner edge and ring outer stroke.
- [ ] Handle tip stays inside the 66dp adaptive-icon safe zone (shorten the handle or nudge the enclosing `group` scale if needed).
- [ ] Verified across densities, the Android 13+ themed/monochrome path, and the splash screen (which reuses the foreground).

**Plan** — push the handle's two inner points (`58.818,65.182` and `65.182,58.818`) outward along the (1,1) diagonal; mirror the change in `ic_launcher_monochrome.xml`. The handle tip is already near the 66dp adaptive-icon safe zone, so this may also mean shortening the handle or nudging the enclosing `group` scale (0.9).

**Tests** — none (Previews only, as with the icon-picker item). Verify across densities, the Android 13+ themed/monochrome path, and the splash screen.

### Audit the hosted privacy policy and Play data-safety form

*Branch: none — external content, not a code change · Complexity: XS · Priority: Medium · Area: Settings*

🌐 **External action** — both live outside this repo and likely still repeat the "nothing leaves the phone" claim that `feat/cloud-backup-toggle` just corrected in-app (About screen, README, HODITH_SPEC §16). The hosted policy is linked from `AboutScreen.kt`'s privacy section; the Play data-safety answers live in Play Console once a listing exists. Neither can be edited from this repo.

**Acceptance criteria**

- [ ] Hosted policy read against the new About copy (HODITH itself sends nothing; Android's own device backup may include HODITH's data unless the user opts out via Settings) and updated wherever it still claims otherwise.
- [ ] Play data-safety answers reconciled with the same copy (once a listing exists).

**Plan** — read both against the new About copy and update wherever they still claim otherwise.

### Intense/Bright theme: exploratory testing pass

*Branch: `chore/intense-bright-theme-audit` · Complexity: S–M · Priority: Low · Area: Settings*

🔍 **Investigation** — a review pass, not a known fix.

Exploratory pass over the Intense and Bright themes (`Color.kt`, `GlowDecoration.kt`, `CardDecorationStyle.kt`, `BigPictureDecoration.kt`, `ShareCardDecoration.kt`) for minor redesigns. Restyle-only — visual refinement of what exists, not new features a mockup might suggest.

**Acceptance criteria**

- [ ] A written pass over both themes across the main screens (Home, Case Detail/Insights, Big Picture, Share, Settings) noting legibility/contrast/consistency issues.
- [ ] A shortlist of proposed tweaks, restyle-only, each with a keep/drop call.
- [ ] Approved tweaks spun out as their own follow-up items.

**Plan** — audit pass first, no code; produce a findings list. Implementation only for approved items, spun out separately.

**Tests** — none for the audit itself.

## Deferred

### D1 · Big Picture's grid query, windowed or not

*Branch: `refactor/big-picture-windowed-query` (if taken) · Complexity: S–M · Priority: Low · Area: Performance*

🔍 **Investigation, deferred** — `BigPictureViewModel` now reads two flat projections (`EventDao.observeActiveCaseEventDetails()`, `TagDao.observeActiveCaseEventTagNames()`) instead of the original `@Transaction @Relation` cascade — removing the chunked `IN (...)` sub-fetches and full-row hydration that were the measured cost. A JVM probe confirmed Kotlin-side mapping is cheap at S6 scale. Undecided: whether the two queries' SQL-scan cost holds up at that scale under a write burst.

**Deferred rather than pursued next** — closing this needs a synthetic S6-scale DB probe with no real usage behind it: speculative complexity. Real alpha usage is a better trigger than a cautionary probe.

**Acceptance criteria**

- [ ] Alpha usage (or a deliberate decision to probe synthetically instead) confirms whether the two flat projections' SQL scans — particularly the tag-attachment join — hold up under a logging burst at real-world scale. This is the decision gate for everything below.
- [ ] If not: a `SELECT DISTINCT` per-case tag-vocabulary query sourcing `allTagNames` directly, rather than flattening every event's tags client-side.
- [ ] If still needed after that: `observeActiveCaseEventDetails` bounded to a loaded month range (half-open bounds, mirroring `eventsInWindow`), extended in chunks as the grid nears the top of its loaded range, well before the user hits the edge. The tag projection stays live-and-windowed alongside it rather than moving to on-demand fetch, unless that's also still too hot.
- [ ] Month-picker quick-jump (§9) extends the loaded range to cover the picked month before scrolling, rather than landing in an unpopulated region.

**Plan** — revisit once alpha usage says whether Big Picture feels slow at scale; only then run the probe, and only build the criteria its result actually calls for, cheapest lever first.

**Tests** — if windowing is taken: `bigPictureUiState` over a windowed event list; a DAO test for the month-range query; Big Picture Compose tests stay green.

**Concern** — scroll-triggered range extension (if taken) must not stutter or flash empty cells on a fast scroll to a distant month.

### D2 · New-case tag suggestions have no history to draw from

*Branch: none — deferred, no fix prescribed · Complexity: S · Priority: Low · Area: Bug*

🔍 **Investigation, deferred**

`TagInput.kt`'s suggestion filtering and case-insensitive dedup (`filterTagSuggestions`) are already correct; every call site (`LogDetailScreenViewModel`, `HomeViewModel`, `WidgetLogSheetViewModel`) sources its candidate list from `repository.observeTagsForCase(caseId)`. A brand-new Case's per-case tag list is empty on its very first tag entry, so nothing suggests, even when the same tag name already exists on other Cases — which is how testers ended up with near-duplicate spellings. Cross-case suggestions were considered and explicitly ruled out, so no fix is prescribed here.

**Acceptance criteria**

- [ ] Revisit with a concrete proposal once one exists — this item exists to hold the observation, not to specify a solution.

**Plan** — none yet; deferred pending a future proposal that doesn't widen tag suggestions across Cases.

**Tests** — none until a proposal is approved.

### D3 · Investigate app capacity at multi-year logging scale

*Branch: none yet — investigation first · Complexity: S (investigation) · Priority: Medium · Area: Performance*

🔍 **Investigation**

Raises the same question **D1** is deferred pending — app capacity for years of records — but broader than D1's Big Picture-specific scope. `EventDao.observeEventsWithTagsForCase` (unbounded) backs every Insights stats computation (and every Watch's Now line) (rhythm, frequency-over-time, trend, duration averages) with no row-count limit; only the Log tab got paged querying (`feat/log-tab-paged-query`). May itself be D1's "real alpha usage" trigger — resolve together with D1 rather than as a separate track.

**Acceptance criteria**

- [ ] A synthetic or real multi-year dataset used to measure current behavior of the unbounded per-case stats query (load time, memory) at a defined scale (e.g. matching D1's S6 reference point).
- [ ] A stated current capacity (rows/years before a defined threshold degrades).
- [ ] A ruling on whether this satisfies D1's alpha-usage gate, supersedes it, or should stay a separate track.
- [ ] If a guardrail is warranted: a shortlist of options (windowed stats queries, a soft in-app warning at N events, etc.) with a keep/drop call each, spun out as their own item(s).

**Plan** — probe first, no production code in this item; read alongside D1 before deciding investigation scope, to avoid running two parallel capacity investigations.

**Tests** — none until a follow-up item lands.

### D4 · Detector: cycles and seasonality (autocorrelation + month-of-year)

*Branch: none yet — deferred, scope narrowed · Complexity: L · Priority: Low · Area: Insights*

🔍 **Investigation, deferred** · 🎨 **Design decision**

Originally scoped three sub-features: autocorrelation for weekly/~28-day cycles, a month-of-year comparison (needs 1+ years of data), and a weekday-vs-weekend fallback. The fallback shipped on its own (`HODITH_SPEC.md` §10). The other two are deferred: autocorrelation is a genuinely new technique (not a reuse of the existing bucket-share/label-shuffle/timeline-shuffle machinery) and needs the most data of any detector here to fire reliably.

**Deferred rather than pursued next** — building this before knowing whether Cases run long enough to show real weekly/monthly structure is speculative complexity. Real alpha usage (Cases with a year-plus of history) is a better trigger.

**Acceptance criteria**

- [ ] Revisit once alpha usage shows Cases commonly reach 1+ years of history (or a deliberate decision to build it sooner).
- [ ] Autocorrelation method + lag set chosen and documented (weekly ~7-day, ~28-day, and any others).
- [ ] Weekly/~28-day cycle detection gated by a minimum span; month-of-year comparison gated on ≥1 year of data.
- [ ] Voice ×3 for the new sentence template(s).
- [ ] Tests: a planted weekly cycle, a planted no-cycle null.
- [ ] `HODITH_SPEC.md` §10 gains one line per kept signal, or a rationale note here for any dropped.

**Plan** — none yet — the weekday-vs-weekend fallback already covers the cheapest, most useful signal of the original three.

**Tests** — none until picked back up.

### D5 · Watch threshold suggestions

*Branch: none yet — deferred, needs alpha usage · Complexity: M · Priority: Low · Area: Notifications*

🎨 **Design decision**

Carried over from the retired Hunch/Trigger feasibility item, re-scoped to Watches. When creating or editing a quiet Watch, suggest a threshold from the Case's 90th-percentile historical gap — `InsightsEngine.computeGapStats` builds the gap list; this adds a percentile helper over it (none exists today). For either kind, show "would have fired N times in the last year" by replaying the (pure, `now`-parameterised) Watch conditions over the past year's events — a historical loop, no new evaluation logic.

**Deferred rather than pursued next** — the editor's shape has settled, so this is deferred purely pending real alpha use showing whether people struggle to pick thresholds at all.

**Acceptance criteria**

- [ ] Revisit once alpha testers have used the Watches tab.
- [ ] A percentile helper over the gap list, with its own unit tests.
- [ ] The replay loop reuses the Watch conditions as-is and is unit-tested against a planted event history.
- [ ] Voice ×3 for the suggestion copy, observational only (no "you should").

**Plan** — none yet.

**Tests** — none until picked back up.

## Blocked

### BL1 · Rate the App is still a placeholder row

*Branch: `feat/rate-app-play-link` · Complexity: S · Priority: Blocked — do it in release prep · Area: Settings*

🌐 **External action** — genuinely gated on a Play Store listing existing. 🎨 **Design decision** — In-App Review would add Google Play Services to a zero-network app; that's a positioning call. Steer: deep link.

The row shows a "coming soon" snackbar — needs a real destination once there's a Play Store listing.

**Acceptance criteria**

- [ ] Implemented in the release-prep branch, not as standalone work.
- [ ] `market://details?id=…` intent with an `https://play.google.com/…` fallback (recommended over the In-App Review API).
- [ ] `SettingsScreenTest` changes from asserting the coming-soon snackbar to asserting the intent launches (Espresso `Intents`).
- [ ] The Bright plank Preview's no-op `onClick` left as-is (not a second call site).

**Plan** — blocked on the listing existing; belongs in the release-prep branch. Two options: a `market://details?id=…` intent with an `https://play.google.com/…` fallback, or the Play In-App Review API. Recommend the deep link — In-App Review adds a Google Play Services dependency to an app that ships none and positions itself as "no network".

**Tests** — `SettingsScreenTest` currently asserts the coming-soon snackbar — change it to assert the intent launches (Espresso `Intents`). The row also appears in `SettingsScreen.kt`'s Bright plank Preview with a no-op `onClick`; no change needed, don't mistake it for a second call site.

**Concern** — In-App Review is quota-limited and no-ops silently once hit, making manual verification unreliable. The deep link is trivially verifiable.

Each significant change ends with a CLEANUP_CHECKLIST.md pass logged in CLEANUP_LOG.md, a TESTING.md check, and this file updated.
